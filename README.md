# theRowDjangoWebsite

The Row E Commerce Website: a simple ecommerce website where members can register and login to view private offers and become part of an 
elite group within the company. “The Row was established in 2006. Named in reverence of London's Savile Row, 
the fashion house emulates the bespoke standards of exquisite fabrics,
impeccable details and perfect fits, translating these values to its womenswear and menswear collections.” 

This is a mock website for The Olsen Twins live site - The collection is quite recognizable amongst my peers so I felt it was a project worth working on.
